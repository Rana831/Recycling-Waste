# Recycling-Waste
Home Cleaning Robot using Computer Vision 
The robot uses an Arduino microcontroller to control the movements of the robot, Ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles, HC-05 Bluetooth module for the communication between the robot and the machine-learning model, Camera for object detection.
Implemented the VGG16 model and OpenCV library for image classification, training it on a recycling waste dataset that contains 9 classes (paper – e-waste – glass – clothes – batteries – metal – organic – plastic – light bulbs) to detect paper waste, Programmed the robot to open a fan if paper waste was detected using the VGG16 model, and to close the fan if other waste was detected and Presented the robot at the CDIS event.
